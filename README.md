# Chatbots
This repository introduces the fundamental creation of chatbots or dialogue systems. Chatbot as a manifestation of artificial intelligence is a virtual and autonomous intelligent agent who can have conversations or negotiate with humans or other chatbots. Chatbot development and power is significantly linked to NLP and pre-training the system on large corpora. Instead of one way communication, chatbot allows interaction in a more human way through conversation which enhances engagement and personalization. 
Chatbots can be classified into two categories: 1) Social chatbots to perform human-like conversations or known as chit chat bots, 2) Task-oriented dialogue agents that use conversation with users to help complete specific tasks.
